# Fortran Project

This project contains several Fortran programs demonstrating basic concepts and functionalities.

## Files

- **f1_hello.f90**: A simple program that prints "Hello".
- **f2_read.f90**: A program that reads two numbers from the user and prints their sum and product.
- **f3_float.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of single and double precision floating-point numbers.
- **f4_block.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of modules and block constructs in Fortran.
- **f5_arrays.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of arrays in Fortran.
- **f6_arrayslicing.f90**: A program demonstrating array slicing in Fortran.
- **f7_allocatablearrays.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of allocatable arrays in Fortran.
- **f8_charstrings.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of character strings in Fortran.
- **f9_allocatablecharstrings.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of allocatable character strings in Fortran.
- **f10_arrayofstrings.f90**: A program demonstrating the use of arrays of strings in Fortran.

## Usage

To compile and run the Fortran programs, use the following commands:

```sh
# Compile f1_hello.f90
gfortran -o hello f1_hello.f90
./hello
```
